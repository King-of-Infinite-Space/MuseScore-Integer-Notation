If `Text style` is set to `Custom`, the added "staff text" are set to style "User-12" then overidden with the styles specified in the following options. This allows selecting all the added texts via `Right click > Select > More > Same subtype`.

Otherwise, the texts are set to style `User-X` which can be edited through `Format > Style > Text styles (bottom of the left list) > User-X`.

By default, style `User-X` applies to the current score only. To make it persistent, go to `Format > Save style` then set the default style in `Edit > Preferences > Score > Style`.
